//How Gabe will make everything collide
	//Add rigidbody2ds + box collider2ds to eveything
	//Everythign should get fixed angle set equal to true
	//Things that will not move should be kinematic


//How Gabe will do knockback
	//On trigger enter just apply force over time in the opposite direction?
